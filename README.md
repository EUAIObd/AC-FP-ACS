## üìñ Introduction
CryptoSuite is a web-based application designed to demonstrate and apply modern cryptographic algorithms. It provides an interactive platform for encrypting, decrypting, and hashing text and files, highlighting the importance of data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in today‚Äôs digital world.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Symmetric Encryption:**  
  - Algorithms: AES, DES, 3DES  
  - Encrypt and decrypt text or files using a shared secret key.

- **Asymmetric Encryption:**  
  - Algorithms: RSA, ECC  
  - Encrypt/decrypt messages, generate and verify digital signatures.

- **Hashing:**  
  - Algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5, BLAKE2  
  - Generate hashes for text and files to ensure data integrity.

- **Digital Signatures:**  
  - ECC-based signing and verification for message authenticity.

- **Modern, Minimalist UI:**  
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
  - Clear error messages and user guidance.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AC-FP-ACS.git
   cd AC-FP-ACS
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## üìù Usage

- Navigate to the desired section (Symmetric, Asymmetric, Hashing).
- Enter your text, file, or key as required.
- Click the appropriate button to encrypt, decrypt, hash, sign, or verify.
- Download results as needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

- This application is for educational purposes only.
- Do **not** use it for real-world sensitive data.
- All cryptographic operations are performed securely, and no user data is stored on the server.

---

## üß© Challenges & Learnings

- Handling various file types and encoding issues.
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
- Providing clear, user-friendly error messages for cryptographic operations.
- Managing dependencies and deployment on PythonAnywhere.

---

## üìà Future Improvements

- Add more cryptographic algorithms (e.g., ChaCha20, SHA-3).
- Enhance mobile support and accessibility.
- Provide more educational content and algorithm explanations.
- Implement authenticated encryption modes (e.g., AES-GCM).
